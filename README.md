This patcher will make WiiWare patching easy to do to use Wiimmfi.

## Usage

Put your WADs (there can be multiple of them) in the folder corresponding to your operating system then run the patch script. Below are instructions to run that.

Windows users:

<ul>
	<li>Double click the "patcher.bat" script to run it. <b>Don't run WiiWarePatcher.exe. After starting up the patcher, follow the instructions on screen. Also, don't forget to put .WADs into the folder with patcher.</b>.</li>
</ul>

Mac/Linux users:

<ul>
	<li>Simply run the patcher.sh script in the same directory as the wads you wish to patch.</li>
</ul>

We recommend installing these WADs with <a href="https://github.com/RiiConnect24/Wii-Mod-Lite/releases">WiiMod Lite</a>.
